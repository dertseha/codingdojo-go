# CodingDojo template - Go

This is a template for a coding dojo. The language is [Go](https://golang.org/)
with [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/) to help get started with testing.

Note that `testify` is not necessary as Go comes with its own testing framework,
it helps to get used when coming from other suite-based frameworks.
